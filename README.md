# ChatBot
ðŸš€ Just Completed My Chatbot Project! ðŸ¤–

I'm excited to share that I've just finished building my first AI-powered chatbot using Python and natural language processing (NLP) techniques! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ”§ What It Does:
Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot can understand and respond to various user inputs, including time requests, and more.
Movie Recommendations: It can recommend movies based on industry (Bollywood/Hollywood) and genre preferences.
Basic Calculations: It handles arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter, the chatbot offers a user-friendly interface with features like music playback and chat history navigation.
ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:
Python: The core language for building the chatbot.
NLTK: For tokenizing, POS tagging, and named entity recognition to understand user queries.
Tkinter: To create an interactive and stylish GUI.
gTTS: For generating and playing music in response to user commands.
This project was a fantastic learning experience, helping me deepen my understanding of NLP, Python, and GUI development. I'm eager to explore more in the world of AI and ML! ðŸŒŸ
